# Real-estate-price-prediction
🏡 Real Estate Analysis Project

A streamlined project analyzing real-estate patterns such as pricing trends, location effects, and factors influencing property values.
Main notebook: GRA real estate.ipynb

📌 Project Highlights

Loaded and explored real-estate datasets for structure and data quality.

Cleaned data by handling missing values, outliers, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formats.

Performed EDA to understand distribution of prices, location-based variations, and correlations.

Engineered new features (e.g., price per sq.ft, property age, encoded categories).

Built simple predictive models to estimate property prices.

Visualized insights using heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts, and trend lines.

Derived insights useful for decision-making (e.g., high-value neighborhoods, major drivers of price).
